# Covaxinator 
Covaxinator is a Vaccine Administration and Tracking Platform that helps Doctors keep track of local vaccine inventory, patient statistics and so much more! It also helps patients find vaccine centers in different locations, get a vaccination certificate, report side effects, look at the safety percentage of an area and followup with their doctor!
